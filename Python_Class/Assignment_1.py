poem="""In shadows deep, where dreams reside,
A tale unfolds, by moon's soft guide.
Whispers dance upon the night,
As stars paint the sky with their gentle light.

Through verdant meadows, where flowers bloom,
The scent of Spring, a sweet perfume.
Each petal's touch, a fleeting caress,
A symphony of colors, to impress.

From lofty peaks to valleys low,
Nature's canvas, a stunning show.
The rivers sing, a peaceful song,
As they journey through woodlands, wild and strong.

Oh, the mysteries that nature weaves,
In fragile webs among the leaves.
From tiny creatures to soaring birds,
Life's harmony, in every word.

And as the seasons come and go,
In nature's rhythm, we learn and grow.
For in its embrace, we find our place,
A reminder of beauty, love, and grace.

So let us ponder, let us roam,
In nature's heart, we find our home.
And may this poem, light and true,
Awaken in you a love anew."""
